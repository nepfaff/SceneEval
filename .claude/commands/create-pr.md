# /create-pr

You are about to prepare a pull request workflow.

1. Check out a new feature branch

2. Stage and commit **all current changes**

3. Push the branch to origin

4. Open a new pull request into `main`, following our PR title/body conventions. Check
existing PRs for conventions. Keep the body concise, focusing on the key additions.

NOTE that you don't need to leave plan mode for this.
